.SH NAME
.B mewa
\- compiler compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mewa
[OPTION]... INPUTFILE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B mewa
is a compiler compiler that builds a
.BR Lua
module implementing a compiler described as a formal grammar in the file \fIINPUTFILE\fR with some 
.BR Lua
callbacks of functions implementing the type system and the code generation.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\--help\fR
Print this usage.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\--version\fR
Print the current version of
.B mewa
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\--verbose\fR
Verbose debug output to stderr.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\--generate-compiler\fR
Do generate a compiler as a
.BR Lua
module described by the grammar in the input file.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\--output=\fR \fIfile\fR
Write the output (parsing tables) to \fIfile\fR instead of stdout.  
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\--luabin=\fR \fIluapath\fR
Specify \fIluapath\fR as path of the
.BR Lua
interpreter in the header of generated scripts. Default is "\fI/usr/bin/lua\fR".
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\--dbgout=\fR \fIfile\fR
Write the verbose debug output (productions,states,functions,etc.) to \fIfile\fR instead of stdout.  
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\--template=\fR \fIfile\fR
Use \fIfile\fR content as template for the generated
.BR Lua
module (option -g/--generate-compiler). The template contains the substitutes \fI%typesystem%\fR (name of the module implementing the type system), \fI%automaton%\fR (
.BR
Lua
table with the generated automaton of the compiler), \fI%language%\fR (name of the language), \fI%luabin%\fR (path of the lua program executing the script, specified by option -b/--luabin) and \fI%cmdline%\fR (name of the module implementing the command-line parser).
