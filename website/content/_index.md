## Introduction
_Mewa_ is a compiler compiler for prototyping of compiler front-ends using _LLVM IR_ or any other comparable intermediate representation
as back-end. The parser generator program _mewa_ generates a _Lua_ module implementing the parser you described in the grammar.
A _Lua_ module written for you in C++ provides some assistance to define your own type system and to generate code.
An example implementation of a non trivial compiler and an FAQ exists to assist you in problem solving.
