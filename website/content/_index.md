 * _Mewa_ is a **compiler-compiler** for **prototyping** of compiler front-ends using _LLVM IR_ or any other comparable intermediate representation
as back-end.
 * The main emphasis of the project is not on the parser generator but on the support for defining a **type system of a modern programming language** with a [declarative approach](/typedbillu.png).
 * A [_Lua_ module written for you](https://github.com/patrickfrey/mewa/blob/master/doc/typedb.md) in C++ provides some assistance to define your own type system and to generate code.
 * An example implementation of a non trivial compiler and an [FAQ](https://github.com/patrickfrey/mewa/blob/master/doc/faq.md) exists to **help you in problem-solving**.
