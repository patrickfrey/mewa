# Background Story

In spring 2020 I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. After the surgery and rehabilitation, I had to undergo a chemotherapy. For this time I decided to make a project that was not bound to anything I was doing at the time. I just wanted to keep my brain spinning.
It had to be something thrilling that kept me thinking about even in endless fatigue. It had to be a about topic I was familiar with. It should have a foreseeable end, so that I could close it after full recovery. 
I decided to bring the prototyping of compiler front-ends into the Lua world, as I didn't see any similar project alive. Lua seemed a perfect choice because of its implementation of closures and because of its of its capabilities for C/C++ integration. I digged out some ideas I had in prevous related attempts.
Finally I had to implement an example compiler that had a complexity big enough to hold the claim. This was the most complicated thing and I have to admit that I underestimated it a little bit. But now I got through.
