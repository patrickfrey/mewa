# Writing Compiler Front-Ends for LLVM with _Lua_ using _Mewa_

## Lead Text
_LLVM IR_ text representation makes it possible to write a compiler front-end without being bound to an API. We can map the source text to the text of LLVM IR and use the tools of the _Clang_ compiler for further compilation steps. This opens the doors to implement compiler front-ends in different ways. _Mewa_ tries to optimize the amount of code written. It targets single authors that would like to write a prototype of a non-trivial programming language fast, but at the expense of a structure supporting collaborative work. This makes it rather a tool for experiment than for building a product.

## Introduction

The _Mewa_ compiler-compiler is a tool to script compiler front-ends in _Lua_. A compiler written with _Mewa_ takes a source file as input and prints an intermediate representation as input for the next compilation step. The example in this tutorial uses the text format of _LLVM IR_ as output. An executable is built using the ```llc``` command of _Clang_.

_Mewa_ provides no support for the evaluation of different paths of code generation. The idea is to do a one-to-one mapping of program structures to code and to leave all analytical optimization steps to the backend.

For implementing a compiler with _Mewa_, you define a grammar attributed with _Lua_ function calls.
The program ```mewa``` will generate a _Lua_ script that will transform any source passing the grammar specified into an _AST_ with the _Lua_ function calls attached to the nodes. The compiler will call the functions of the top-level nodes of the _AST_ that take the control of the further processing of the compiler front-end. The functions called with their _AST_ node as argument invoke the further tree traversal. The types and data structures of the program are built and the output is printed in the process.


## Goals

This tutorial starts with some self-contained examples of using the _Lua_ library of _Mewa_ to build the type system of your programming language. Self-contained means that nothing is used but the library. The examples are also not dependent on each other. This allows you to continue reading and return to the snippets you did not
understand completely later.

After this, the tutorial will guide you through the implementation of a compiler for a reduced and incomplete programming language.
The example program we will compile is the following:
```
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_program
```
We will compile this program with the tutorial compiler and run it in a shell. We will also look at different parts including the grammar of the language.
Finally, I will talk about the features missing in the language to give you some outlook on how to implement a compiler of a complete programming language.


## Target Audience

To understand this article some knowledge about formal languages and parser generators is helpful. To understand the examples you should be familiar with some scripting languages that have a concept of closures similar to _Lua_. If you have read a tutorial about _LLVM IR_, you will get grip on the code generation in the examples.

## Deeper Digging

For a deeper digging you have to look at the _Mewa_ project itself and the implementation of the main example language, a strongly typed multiparadigm programming language with structures, classes, interfaces, free functions, generics, lambdas and exceptions. There exists an [FAQ](faq.md) that also tries to answer problem-solving questions.

## Tutorial, Part 1 

### Declaring a variable

Let's start with a complicated example that is a substantial step forward. 
We print the LLVM code needed to assign a variable value to another variable. 
For this, we need to introduce **types** and **reductions**.

#### Introduction
##### Types
Types are items represented as integers. They are declared and retrieved by the name of the type and a context type.
The context type is itself a type or 0.
Global free variables have for example no associated context type and are declared with 0 as context type. 
Types are associated with a constructor. A constructor is a value, structure, or a function that describes the construction of the type.
Optionally, types can have parameters attached. Parameters are a list of type/constructor pairs. Types are declared with 
```Lua
typeid = typedb:def_type( contextType, name, constructor, parameters)
```
The ```typeid``` returned is the integer that represents the type for the _typedb_.
##### Reductions
Reductions are paths to derive a type from another. You can imagine the typesystem as a directed graph of vertices (types) and edges (reductions).
We will introduce some concepts that allow a partial view of this graph later. For now, imagine it as a graph.
Reductions have also an associated constructor. The constructor describes the construction of the type in the direction of the reduction from its source.
Here is an example:
```Lua
typedb:def_reduction( destType, srcType, constructor, 1)
```
The 1 as parameter is an integer value we will explain later.
##### Resolve Type
Types can be resolved by their name and a single or a list of context types, one having a path of reductions to the context type of the resolved type.
##### Derive type
Types can be constructed by querying a reduction path from one type to another and constructing the type from the source type constructor
by applying the list of constructors on this path. 

Let's have a look at the example:

#### Source
File examples/variable.lua
```Lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_variable
```
#### Output
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_variable
```
#### Conclusion
If you got here you got already quite far. We saw the application of an operator ('=') with an argument. 
Applying a function with more than one argument is imaginable. 
The first match of the operator was our candidate match chosen as a result. But selecting a match by other criteria is imaginable.
We declared a variable with a name, a concept of scope is missing here. We will look at scopes in the next example.


### Scope

Now let's see how scope is represented in the _typedb_.

#### Introduction
Scope in _Mewa_ is represented as a pair of non-negative integer numbers. The first number is the start, the first scope step that belongs to the scope, the second number the end, the first scope step that is not part of the scope. Scope steps are generated by a counter with increments declared in the grammar of your language parser.
All declarations in the _typedb_ are bound to a scope, all queries of the _typedb_ are bound to the current scope step. A declaration is considered to contribute to the result if its scope is covering the scope step of the query.

##### Set the current scope
```Lua
scope_old = typedb:scope( scope_new )
```
##### Get the current scope
```Lua
current_scope = typedb:scope()
```

The example is fairly artificial, but it shows how it works:

#### Source
File examples/scope.lua
```Lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_scope
```
#### Output
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_scope
```
#### Conclusion
This was easy, wasn't it? What is missing now is how the current scope step and scope are set. I chose the variant of treating it as an own aspect. 
The function used for the _AST_ tree traversal sets the current scope step and scope. This works for most cases. Sometimes you have to set the scope manually in nodes that implement declarations of different scopes, like for example function declarations with a function body in an own scope.


### Reduction Weight

Now we have to look again at something a little bit puzzling. We have to assign a weight to reductions. The problem is that even trivial examples of type queries lead to ambiguity if we do not introduce a weighting scheme that memorizes a preference. Real ambiguity is something we want to detect as an error.
I concluded that it is best to declare all reduction weights at one central place in the source and to document it well.

Let's have a look at an example without weighting of reductions that will lead to ambiguity. 

#### Failing example
File examples/weight1.lua
```Lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_weight1
```
#### Output
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_weight1
```
#### Adding weights
File examples/weight2.lua

Here is a diff with the edits we have to make for fixing the problem:
```
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_weight_diff
```
#### Output with weights
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_weight2
```
#### Conclusion
We introduced a 5th parameter of the ```typedb:def_reduction``` command that is 0 if not specified. 
This new parameter is meant to be declared in a way that it memorizes a preference of solution paths. 
The weights should be referenced by constants we declare at a central place where the trains of thought that led to the weighting schema are documented.


### Reduction Tag

The display of the typesystem as one graph is not enough for all cases. There are type derivation paths that are fitting in one case and undesirable in other cases. The following example declares an object of a class derived from a base class that calls a constructor function with no arguments. The constructor function is only declared for the base class. But when calling an object constructor an error should be reported if it does not exist for the class. The same behavior as for a method call is bad in this case.

Let's first look at an example failing:

#### Failing example
File examples/tags1.lua
```Lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_tags1
```
#### Output
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_tags1
```
#### Adding tags
File examples/tags2.lua

Here is a diff with the edits we have to make for fixing the problem:
```
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_tags_diff
```
#### Output with tags
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_tags2
```
#### Conclusion
We explained now the 4th parameter of the ```typedb:def_reduction``` defined as ```1``` in the first examples. It is the mandatory tag assigned to the reduction.
The command ```typedb.reduction_tagmask``` is used to declare named sets of tags selected for resolving and deriving types.

#### Remark
```typedb:derive_type``` has a second optional tag mask parameter that selects reductions to count and limit to a specified number, 1 by default.
The aim behind that is to allow restrictions on some classes of reductions. Most statically typed programming languages impose restrictions on the number of conversions of a parameter. The second tag mask helps you to implement such restrictions.  


### Objects with a Scope

In a compiler, we have building blocks that are bound to a scope. For example functions. These building blocks are best represented as objects. If we are in the depth of an _AST_ tree traversal we would like to have a way to address these objects without complicated structures passed down as parameters. This would be very error-prone. Especially in a non strictly typed language as _Lua_. 

#### Introduction
##### Define object instance in the current scope
```Lua
typedb:set_instance( name, obj)
```
##### Get the object instance of this or the nearest enclosing scope
```Lua
obj = typedb:get_instance( name)
```
##### Get the object instance declared of the current scope
```Lua
obj = typedb:this_instance( name)
```

#### Source
```Lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_env
```
#### Output
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_env
```
#### Conclusion
The possibility of attaching named objects to a scope is a big deal for readability, an important property for prototyping.
It brings structure into a system in an interpreter context where we have few possibilities to ensure safety by contracts.


### Control Structures, Implementing an IF
The next step is implementing an IF and to introduce a new class of type. 
Most programming languages require that the evaluation of a boolean expression stops when its outcome is determined.
An expression like ```if ptr && ptr->value()``` should not crash in the case ptr is a NULL pointer.

#### Introduction
For evaluating boolean expressions and as condition type of conditionals we define two new types.
##### Control True Type
This type has a field ```code``` that holds the code executed as long as it evaluates to true and a field ```out``` that holds an unbound label where the control branches to in case of evaluating to false.
##### Control False Type
This type is the mirror type of the control true type. It has a field ```code``` that holds the code that is executed as long as it evaluates to false and a field ```out``` that holds an unbound label where the control branches to in case of evaluating to true.
##### The IF statement
The IF takes the condition argument and transforms it into a control true type. The code of the resulting constructor is joined with the constructor code of the statements to evaluate in the case the condition is true. At the end, the unbound label is bound and declared at the end of the code.

#### Source
```Lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_control
```
#### Output
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_control
```

#### Conclusion
Control structures are implemented by constructing the control boolean types required. Boolean operators as the logical **AND** or the logical **OR** are constructed by wiring control boolean types together. This has not been done in this example, but it is imaginable after constructing an **IF**. The construction of types with reduction rules does not stop here. Control structures are not entirely different animals.

We have seen the whole variety of functions of the _typedb_ library now. The remaining functions not explained yet are convenient functions to set and get attributes of types. There is nothing substantial left to explain about the API though there is a lot more to talk about best practices and how to use this API.

I think we are now ready to look at our example compiler as a whole.


## Tutorial, Part 2

In the second part of the tutorial we will take a look at the implementation of the example language.
This chapter will be more about best practices as far as I know and not about explaining the typedb API.
The code shown now will be more organised into subparts, more complete, but not self-contained anymore.

Because the amount of code in this second part, we will not inspect it so closely anymore. 
We change now from a walk through to an inspection with a helicopter.

But I hope that after the first part of the tutorial you will still get a grip on the code shown.

First we take a look at the grammar of the language.

### Grammar

### Introduction

#### Parser Generator
_Mewa_ implements an _LALR(1)_ parser generator. The source file of the attributed grammar has 3 parts. 

  * Some configuration marked with a prefix '**%**'
  * The named lexems as a regular expression that matches the lexem value as argument.
  * An attributed grammar with keywords as strings and lexem or production names as identifiers

#### Production Attribute Operators
The operator **>>** in the production attributes in oval brackets on the right side is incrementing the scope-step.
The operator **{}** in the production attributes is defining a scope range.

#### Production Head Attributes
The attributes **L1**,**L2**,... are defining the production to be left associative with a priority specified as a number. 
The attributes **R1**,**R2**,... are defining the production to be right associative with a priority specified as a number. 

#### Source
```
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_grammar
```

### Typesystem
Now let's overview the implementation of the typesystem module that generates the code.

In contrary to the example **language1**, the proof of concept language for _Mewa_, the typesystem module  of the tutorial language has been splitted in several parts of maximum 100 lines of code to make them digestible in a tutorial. The snippets are included with the _Lua_ command _dofile_. The snippets implementing helper functions are in the directory ```tutorial/sections```. The snippets implementing the functions attached to the **AST** nodes are in the directory ```tutorial/ast```.

#### Header
Let's first take a look at the header of the typesystem.lua. 

##### Submodule llvmir
The submodule ```llvmir``` implements all templates for the LLVM IR code generation. We sah such templates like ```{out} = load i32, i32* {this}``` with substututes in curly brackets in the examples of the first part of the tutorial. In the example compiler these templates are all declared in the module ```llvmir``` and referred to by name. The module ```llvmir``` has a submodule ```llvmir_scalar``` that is generated from a description of the scalar types of our language.

##### Submodule utils
The submodule ```typesystem_utils``` implements functions that are language independent. For example the function ```constructor_format``` that instantiated the llvmir code templates in the first part of the tutorial is implemented there in a more sophisticated form. String encoding, mangling, and AST tree traversal functions are other examples.

##### Global variables
The approach of _Mewa_ is not pure. Things are stored in the _typedb_ if it helps. For everything else we use global variables. I tried to keep the API of the _typedb_ as minimal as reasonable. The header of ```typesystem.lua ``` has about a dozen global variables declared. In the example **language1** there are a lot more.

##### Source
```
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_typesystem
```

#### Constants
##### AST nodes
```Lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_ast_constants
```
##### Functions
```Lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_section_constexprTypes
```

#### Variables
Now we will look at variables, including free variables, member variables, and function parameter.
In the grammar all elements are context free. A variable definition
