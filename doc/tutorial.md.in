# Writing Compiler Front-Ends for LLVM with Lua using Mewa

## Lead Text
LLVM IR text representation makes it possible to write a compiler front-end without being bound to an API. We can map the source text to the text of LLVM IR and use the tools of the clang compiler for further compilation steps. This opens the doors to implement compiler front-ends in different ways. Mewa tries to optimize the amount of code written. It targets single authors that would like to write a prototype of a non-trivial programming language fast, but at the expense of a structure supporting collaborative work. This makes it rather a tool for experiment than for building a product.

## Introduction

The Mewa compiler-compiler is a tool to script compiler front-ends in Lua. A compiler written with Mewa takes a source file as input and prints an intermediate representation as input for the next compilation step. The example in this tutorial uses the text format of LLVM IR as output. An executable is built using the ```llc``` command of _Clang_.

Mewa provides no support for the evaluation of different paths of code generation. The idea is to do a one-to-one mapping of program structures to code and to leave all analytical optimization steps to the backend.

For implementing a compiler with Mewa, you define a grammar attributed with Lua function calls.
The program ```mewa``` will generate a Lua script that will transform any source passing the grammar specified into an AST with the Lua function calls attached to the nodes. The compiler will call the functions of the top level nodes of the AST that take the control of the further processing of the compiler front-end. The functions called with their AST node as argument invoke the further tree traversal. The types and data structures of the program are built and the output is printed in the process.


## Goals

This tutorial starts with some self-contained examples of using the Lua library of Mewa to build the type system of your programming language. Self-contained means that nothing is used but the library. After this, the tutorial will guide you through the implementation of a compiler for a reduced and incomplete programming language.
The example program we will compile is the following:
```
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_program
```
We will compile this program with the tutorial compiler and run it in a shell. We will also look at different parts including the grammar of the language.
Finally, I will talk about the features missing in the language to give you some outlook on how to implement a compiler of a complete programming language.


## Target Audience

To understand this article some knowledge about formal languages and parser generators is helpful. To understand the examples you should be familiar with some scripting languages that have a concept of closures similar to Lua. If you have read a tutorial about LLVM IR, you will get grip on the code generation in the examples.

## Deeper Digging

For a deeper digging you have to look at the Mewa project itself and the implementation of the main example language, a strongly typed multiparadigm programming language with structures, classes, interfaces, free functions, generics, and exceptions. There exists an [FAQ](faq.md) that also tries to answer problem-solving questions.


## Tutorial, Part 1 

### Declaring a variable

Let's start with an example that is complicated but a substantial step forward. 
We print the LLVM code needed to assign a variable value to another variable. 
For this, we need to introduce **types** and **reductions**.

##### Types
Types are items represented as integers. They are declared and retrieved by a string, the name of the type, and a context type.
The context type is a type declared before or 0.
Global free variables have for example no associated context type and are declared with 0 as context type. 
Types are associated with a constructor. A constructor is a value, structure or a function that describes the construction of the type.
Optionally, types are associated with arguments. Arguments are list of type/constructor pairs. Types are declared with 
```Lua
	typeid = typedb:def_type( contextType, name, constructor, parameter)
```
The ```typeid``` returned is the integer that represents the type for the typedb.
##### Reductions
Reductions are paths to derive a type from another. You can imagine the typesystem as a directed graph of vertices (types) and edges (reductions).
We will introduce some concepts that allow a partial view on this graph later. For now, imagine it as a graph.
Reductions have also an associated constructor. The constructor describes the construction of the type in the direction of the reduction from its source.
Here is an example:
```Lua
	typedb:def_reduction( destType, srcType, constructor, 1)
```
The 1 as parameter is an integer value we will explain later.
##### Resolve Type
Types can be resolved by their name and a context type having a path of reductions to the context type declaration.
##### Derive type
Types can be constructed by querying a reduction path from one type to another and constructing the type from the source type constructor
by applying the list of constructors on this path.

Let's have a look at the example:

#### Source
```lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_variable
```
#### Output
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_variable
```

### The Concept of Scope

#### Source
```lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_scope
```
#### Output
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_scope
```

### Weight of Reductions

#### Failing example
```lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_weight1
```
#### Output
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_weight1
```
#### Adding weights
```
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_weight_diff
```
#### Output with weights
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_weight2
```

### Tags of Reductions

#### Failing example
```lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_tags1
```
#### Output
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_tags1
```
#### Adding tags
```
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_tags_diff
```
#### Output with tags
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_tags2
```


### Objects with Scope

#### Source
```lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_env
```
#### Output
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_env
```


### Control Structures, Implementing an IF

#### Source
```lua
$EXAMPLE:tutorial_control
```
#### Output
```
$EXAMOUT:tutorial_control
```
